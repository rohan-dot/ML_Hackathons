# ML_Hackathons
Some of the hackathons i took part in over the summer
DATA_HACK_COMPETITION -: Analytics vidhya organized a student hackathon for machine learning enthusiasts. This was my first hackathon and I took part in it during my end sem exams(DATA_HACK_COMPETITON) and used my knowloedge of ensemble learners for this classification problem.
To look back upon I can spot many changes in it that couldhave made me finish in the top 50
I finished 187 out of the total 1100 registered participants
datahackbetter-: After going through my first Udacity project I implemented the same problem using a neural network in keras achieving an accuracy of 68% in hidden test set 


American Express Artificial intelligence Problem statement 2
I came to know of this event on the last day of the competition itself with a little more than 10hrs remaining but still managed to recieve an overall accuracy of 91.8% with the highest being 96%

I used xgboost and baesian optimization for parametertuning
I also tried using the extra tree classifier for feature selection but that did'nt improve my accuracy
